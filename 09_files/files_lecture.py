'''
FILES
- allow us to persist data between program runs
- allow us to read in data to our program without having to
modify hard-coded values in our program
- file modes determine if we are reading/writing/appending to a file
- you have to specify which file mode you want when you open a file
    - r: read
    - w: write
    - a: write with append
