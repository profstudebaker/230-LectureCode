# 230 Lecture Code
This repository includes the code examples from my lectures of CPSC230 - Computer Science I in Python. Code will be pushed at the end of each week to reflect any updates or new examples.

Feel free to play around with this code in an [online code editor](https://replit.com/@studebaker/230-LectureCode).
