# Functions 

1. Write a function that takes a string and returns the string reversed in upper case.

2. Define a function minimum() that takes 3 separate integers as parameters and returns the smallest number of the 3.

3. Define a function counter() that takes a string as parameter and counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in it, and then prints out those numbers. (Your function won't return anything)

4. Write a function a() that returns the string 'hello'. Write a function b() that returns the string 'world'. Write a function c() that calls functions a and b in its body, and concatenates their return values to return 'hello world'.

5. Write a function that takes in a list of test scores and returns the number of passing grades (scores that are greater than or equal to 70). 

6. Write a username generator function that takes in a student's first and last names as parameters and then returns a username made with the first 4 letters of the last name and then the first letter of the first name in all lower case. Example: get_username("Murphy","Studebaker") would return "studm"
